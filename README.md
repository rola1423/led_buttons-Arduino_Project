# Arduino LED Button Control 

This project simulates controlling 3 LEDs using 3 push buttons with an Arduino UNO, designed and tested in Tinkercad Circuits.


# How It Works

Each button controls one LED:
- Pressing Button 1 (connected to pin 2) turns on LED 1 (pin 10)
- Pressing Button 2 (connected to pin 3) turns on LED 2 (pin 11)
- Pressing Button 3 (connected to pin 4) turns on LED 3 (pin 12)

The buttons are connected between 5V and the digital pins.
